# Stock Trend Prediction Using LSTM
The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many of the researchers and analysts. In fact, investors are highly interested in the research area of stock price prediction. For a good and successful investment, many investors are keen on knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems for stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock market. In this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to predict stock market indices.

# Long Short Term Memory
LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is because LSTM is able to store past information that is important, and forget the information that is not. LSTM has three gates:

   **The input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state.**
   **The forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model**  
    **The output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output**
